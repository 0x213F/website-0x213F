## Level 1

Tyler is trying to say that Donald Glover dropped a dope album but people are sleeping on it.

## Level 2

For the uninitiated, Tyler is no stranger to coarse language. He also has a history of expressing himself in _opposite_.

## Level 3

Tyler does not actually think that Donald is a "dickfuck." Tyler means the _opposite_.

## Level 4

About a year ago, Tyler arranged [a surprise performance by Drake](https://livemusicblog.com/news/drake-makes-surprise-appearance-at-camp-flog-gnaw/). The audience in attendance was not receptive of Drake's performance.

_The subtext of this tweet is Tyler speaking to his fans._

Tyler relates to Donald because _they both did "cryptic"_ things that their fans didn't appreciate.

## Level 5

News outlets published the narrative that Tyler was actually mad at Donald.

Source [one](https://www.complex.com/music/2020/12/tyler-the-creator-praises-childish-gambino-3-15-20) and [two](https://uproxx.com/music/tyler-the-creator-donald-glover-3-15-20/]).

## Level 6

Once again, Tyler is being cryptic.

Once again, Tyler falls flat.

Instead of trying to explain himself, Tyler understandably deleted the above tweet in order to mitigate damage.

## Level 7

From the above, you may choose to justify the conclusion that both Tyler and Donald had _good intensions_ and were just _misunderstood by the masses_. [They tried](https://0x213F.com/They-tried).

## Level 8

I would be remiss not to take this opportunity to further highlight that [**Donald Glover's album 3.15.20 was legendary**](https://0x213F.com/No-sound).
