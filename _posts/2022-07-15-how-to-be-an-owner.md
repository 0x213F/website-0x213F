## part one: the owner

    (figure 1)

    ·

    diagram: single point

the single point in (figure 1) represents _the business owner_, the person who controls a business and all of its operations.

when a business's profits exceed its expenditures, _the business owner_ must decide where to reinvest the excess money. the most popular investment strategy amongst owners is to hire employees:

    (figure 2)

    diagram: two points and a double-sided arrow

_thereby, the right point is born._

the choice to hire _an employee_ is done under the presumption that the cost of their labor will be less than the value they add to the company.

    (figure 3)

    [   salary of employee   ] <  [    value added to company     ]
    [ value added to company ] == [ value added to business owner ]

**ultimately, _the employee_ is an asset** and should be considered a part of the company's investment strategy.

## part two: the employee

after reading the previous section, **_the employee may begin to question their reality:_**

* will i get paid more if i work harder?
* will i get paid more if the business succeeds?
* what happens if business goes poorly?
* why should i work hard to make the owners richer?

the worker is left with a few choices:

* do nothing and accept reality
  * _"this job is a means to live my life outside of work"_
  * _accept reality_
* quit and get another job
  * _the same problems will persist at the new job_
* quit to become an owner
  * _see the guide on [how to be an owner](https://0x213F.com/how-to-be-an-owner)_
* **classified - employee access only**
* **classified - employee access only**

## part three: perspective from the owner

after reading the previous section, **_the owner begins to worry about their assets:_**

* are my employees really trying their hardest?
* are my employees really passionate about making me richer?

_the owner_ needs to ensure their workers are productive and motivated.

to accomplish this, **_the owner must understand the psychology of a cog._**

<br>

## part four: the psychology of a cog

a good cog is grateful for their job. **_reasons why cogs are happy and don't question their surroundings:_**

* "the hours of this job are so relaxed and flexible!"
* "this job pays good money; why would i ever leave?"
* "money can't buy happiness, and this job makes me happy."
* "i literally couldn't find another job if i tried. it's tough out there."

in summary, the 4 things to focus on in order to grease up _the cogs_ are:

1. hours
1. wages
1. working conditions
1. manipulate the job market (realistically not possible)

... admittedly, these aren't great options.

_the owner_ probably wants people to work more and get paid less; they want _their investment_ to have the highest possible roi.

to accomplish this, **_you must understand the psychology of an owner._**

## <span id="part-five">part five: the psychology of an owner</span>

_your goal is manipulate the emotional state of employees so that they:_

* accept lower wages
* put in extra hours
* are fully productive while at work

to accomplish this, you should take note of how _employees_ perceive _the owner_.

**the owner should absolve their ego and be reborn as _an employee_.**

    (figure 4)

    [[ company ]] <—————— ··

    diagram: two points and an arrow pointing to the company

a typical _employee_ should work hard to uphold the company. (increase profits, hit kpis, et al.)

as such, _the owner_ should be seen as synonymous to an employee.

_the owner_ works hard and a carrot dangling in front of themselves, just as it is done for _the others_.

if done correctly, this should build camaraderie amongst _the entire team_. _everyone_ should be happily working toward a common goal due to "aligned incentives."

... unbeknownst to _the employees_:

* _the owner_ don't actually work as many hours as _they_ do.
* _the owner_ gets paid more than _they_ do.
* **_the owner_ has more carrot than _they_ do.**

to verify things are running as expected, **make certain that _everyone_ is unquestioning and satisfied with the company's pyramid-like compensation structure.**

    (figure 5)

                   .

             /===========\''   \
            /=============\ ' '  \

## part six: rusty cogs

there are going to be some _"free thinking" cogs_ that still remain. they might be wondering:

* i don't get paid enough
* when do i get my carrot?
* what is my job security?
* why is everyone two faced?

it is probably best for <a href="#part-five">_the company_</a> to get rid of _rusty cogs_.

<br>

## part seven: getting rid of rusty cogs

follow these steps:

1. over-hire
1. _"oops, we over-hired. now we have to do layoffs"_
1. dispose of the rusty cogs
1. instill both **fear** and **gratitude** into those that remain
1. repeat
