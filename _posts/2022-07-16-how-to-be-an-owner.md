## part one: the owner

    (figure 1)

    ·

    diagram: single point

the single point in (figure 1) represents _the business owner_, the person who controls a business and all of its operations.

<span id="figure-two">when a business's profits exceed its expenditures, _the business owner_ must decide where to reinvest the excess money. the most popular investment strategy amongst owners is to hire employees:</span>

    (figure 2)

    · <——————> ·

    diagram: two points and a double-sided arrow

_thereby, the right point is born._

the choice to hire _an employee_ is done under the presumption that the cost of their labor will be less than the value they add to the company.

    (figure 3)

    [   salary of employee   ] <  [    value added to company     ]
    [ value added to company ] == [ value added to business owner ]

    diagram: mathematical representation of an employee

**ultimately, _the employee_ is an asset** and should be considered a part of the company's investment strategy.

## part two: the employee

after reading the previous section, **_the employee may begin to question their reality:_**

* _"will i get paid more if i work harder?"_
* _"will i get paid more if the business succeeds?"_
* _"what happens if business goes poorly?"_
* _"why should i work hard to make the owners richer?"_

the worker is left with a few choices:

* do nothing and accept reality
  * _"this job is a means to live my life outside of work"_
  * _accept reality_
* quit and get another job
  * _the same problems will persist at the new job_
* quit to become an owner
  * _see the guide on [how to be an owner](https://0x213F.com/how-to-be-an-owner)_
* **classified - employee access only**
* **classified - employee access only**

## part three: perspective from the owner

after reading the previous section, **_the owner begins to worry about their assets:_**

* _"are my employees really trying their hardest?"_
* _"are my employees really passionate about making me richer?"_

_the owner_ needs to ensure their workers are productive and motivated.

to accomplish this, **_the owner must understand the psychology of a cog._**

<br>

## part four: the psychology of a cog

a good cog is grateful for their job. **_reasons why cogs are happy and don't question their surroundings:_**

* _"the hours of this job are so relaxed and flexible!"_
* _"this job pays good money; why would i ever leave?"_
* _"money can't buy happiness, and this job makes me happy."_
* _"i literally couldn't find another job if i tried. it's tough out there."_

in summary, the 4 things to focus on in order to grease up _the cogs_ are:

1. hours
1. wages
1. working conditions
1. manipulate the job market (realistically, not possible)

...admittedly, these aren't great options.

_the owner_ probably wants people to work more and get paid less; they want to maximize the roi on _their investment_.

to accomplish this, **_the owner must understand the psychology of an owner._**

<br>

## <span id="part-five">part five: the psychology of an owner</span>

_goal: to manipulate the emotional state of employees so that they:_

* accept lower wages
* put in extra hours
* are fully productive while at work

to accomplish this, _the owner_ must consider the perceived gap <a href="#figure-two">(figure 2)</a> between them and their _employees_.

**the owner should absolve their ego and be reborn as _an employee_.**

    (figure 4)

    [[ company ]] <—————— ··

    diagram: two points and an arrow pointing to the company

a typical _employee_ should work hard to uphold the company. (increase profits, hit kpis, et al.)

**_reminder: employees should (subconsciously) be fearful for their wellbeing. this should increase productivity amongst employees, ensuring the company's success._**

as such, _the owner_ should be seen as synonymous to an employee. "one of us."

if done correctly, this should build camaraderie amongst _the entire team_. the idea is to convince _employees_ that everyone is happily working toward a common goal due to "aligned incentives."

...unbeknownst to _the employees_:

* _the owner_ don't actually work as many hours as _they_ do.
* _the owner_ gets paid more than _they_ do.
* _the owner_ "steers the ship" (makes all the decisions)

to verify things are running as expected, **make certain that _everyone_ is unquestioning, satisfied, and deeply fearful.**

<span id="figure-five">once this dynamic is set, the company is destined to have a pyramid-like power structure.</span>

    (figure 5)

## part six: rusty cogs

there are going to be some _"free thinking" cogs_ that still remain. they might be wondering:

* _"i don't get paid enough"_
* _"when do i get my carrot?"_
* _"what is my job security?"_
* _"why is everyone two faced?"_

they also might:

* not embody company values
* not be working as hard as they could
* not be delivering a return on investment

it is probably best for <a href="#part-five">_the company_</a> to get rid of _rusty cogs_.

<br>

---

## <span id="part-seven">part seven: getting rid of rusty cogs</span>

follow these steps:

1. over-hire
1. _"oops, we over-hired. now we have to do layoffs"_
1. dispose of the rusty cogs
1. instill both **fear** and **gratitude** into those that remain
1. <span style="color: red;">**repeat**</span>

<br>

## part eight: compliance

for companies where:

* they are seeking vc (venture capital) funding
* vc already has majority control of board

**<a href="#part-seven">the steps outlined in part seven</a> are a frequent prescription.** you may be required to comply.

for more information on ownership compliance, please refer to <a href="#figure-five">figure five</a>.

<span style="color: red;">**please be mindful of who your real owner is.**</span>
