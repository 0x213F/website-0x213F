## Dualities

The duality of <span style="color: BlueViolet;">introversion</span> is that it both:

- _creates a safe space for reflection_.
- _builds a pressing force (increasing as a function of time) towards <span style="color: DarkOrange;">extroversion</span>_.

The duality of <span style="color: DarkOrange;">extroversion</span> is that it both:

- _stimulates growth by experience_.
- _builds a pressing force (increasing as a function of time) towards <span style="color: BlueViolet;">introversion</span>_.

Acknowledging the _forces connecting <span style="color: BlueViolet;">introversion</span> and <span style="color: DarkOrange;">extroversion</span>_ has brought great clarity to my being.

As such, I try my best to balance these forces and harmoniously dance within them.

## Zedd

Consider these forces in the context of personal relationships.

**Kehlani**’s vocal performance on [**Good Thing**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMla2ZIz7-4) accurately depicts _the state of resisting a large pressing force towards <span style="color: DarkOrange;">extroversion</span>_.

**Katy Perry**’s vocal performance on [**365**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrbgUtCfnC0) accurately depicts _the state of resisting a large pressing force towards <span style="color: BlueViolet;">introversion</span>_.
