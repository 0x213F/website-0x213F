## Dualities

The duality of <span style="color: BlueViolet;">introversion</span> is that it both:

- Creates a safe space for reflection.
- Builds a pressing _force_ towards <span style="color: DarkOrange;">extroversion</span> (increasing as a function of time).

The duality of <span style="color: DarkOrange;">extroversion</span> is that it both:

- Stimulates growth by experience.
- Builds a pressing _force_ towards <span style="color: BlueViolet;">introversion</span> (increasing as a function of time).

Acknowledging the _forces_ connecting <span style="color: BlueViolet;">introversion</span> and <span style="color: DarkOrange;">extroversion</span> has brought great clarity to my being.

As such, I try my best to balance these and harmoniously dance within their _force field_.

## Zedd

Consider these _forces_ in the context of personal relationships.

**Kehlani**’s vocal performance on [**Good Thing**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMla2ZIz7-4) accurately depicts _the state of resisting a large pressing force_ towards <span style="color: DarkOrange;">extroversion</span>.

**Katy Perry**’s vocal performance on [**365**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrbgUtCfnC0) accurately depicts _the state of resisting a large pressing force_ towards <span style="color: BlueViolet;">introversion</span>.
