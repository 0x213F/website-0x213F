Bad decisions are bound to happen. **How** bad decisions are created means everything.

## Individual

_"No one is perfect."_

When it comes to an individual making a decision, _faults and weaknesses are expected_.

Think about this from the perspective of an engineering manager. Would they ever let an engineer design and implement an entire feature <u>without any input from the rest of the team?</u>

## Collective

_"All for one and one for all."_

If the group makes the decision together, _the outcome is always tolerated_.

Think about the importance of group decisions when it comes to things like: architecture proposals, code reviews, testing and verification.

## In other words

Why would you let [one person make such an important decision](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/30/technology/basecamp-politics-ban-resignations.html) <u>without any input from the rest of the team?</u>

## My recommendation

**Make more decisions democratically.**

Democracy is something you need to further implement in your workplace. If you doubt this, leave it up to a democratic poll:

> "Would our company benefit from additional democratic decision making processes?"

You must **address this problem at its root cause**, otherwise you risk a recurrent controversy.
