Bad decisions are bound to happen. **How** bad decisions are created means everything.

## Individual

_"No one is perfect."_

When it comes to an individual making a decision, _faults and weaknesses are expected_.

## Collective

_"All for one and one for all."_

If the group makes the decision together, _the outcome is always tolerated_.

## In other words

When something as crazy as [1/3 of your employees quitting](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/30/technology/basecamp-politics-ban-resignations.html) happens, it makes you wonder how out of touch the CEO is with the people at their company.

## My recommendation

**Make more decisions democratically.**

<u>Democracy is something you need to further implement in your workplace.</u> If you doubt this, leave it up to a democratic poll:

> "Would our company benefit from additional democratic decision making processes?"

You must **address this problem at its root cause**, otherwise <u>you risk a recurrent controversy</u>.
