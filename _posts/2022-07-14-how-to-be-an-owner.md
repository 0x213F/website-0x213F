## part one: the owner

    (figure 1)

    ·

    diagram: single point

the single point in (figure 1) represents _the business owner_, the person who controls a business and all of its operations.

when a business's profits exceed its expenditures, _the business owner_ must decide where to reinvest the excess money. the most popular investment strategy amongst owners is to hire employees:

    (figure 2)

    · <——————> ·

    diagram: two points and a double-sided arrow

_thereby, the right point is born._

the choice to hire _an employee_ is done under the presumption that the cost of their labor will be less than the value they add to the company.

    (figure 3)

    [   salary of employee   ] <  [    value added to company     ]
    [ value added to company ] == [ value added to business owner ]

    diagram: mathematical representation of an employee

**ultimately, _the employee_ is an asset** and should be considered a part of the company's investment strategy.

## part two: the employee

after reading the previous section, _the employee may begin to question their reality:_

* will I get paid more if I work harder?
* will I get paid more if the business succeeds?
* what happens if business goes poorly?
* why should I work hard to make the owners richer?

the worker is left with a few choices:

* do nothing and accept reality
  * _"this job is a means to live my life outside of work"_
  * accept reality
* quit and get another job
  * the same problems will persist at the new job
* quit to become an owner
  * see the guide on [how to be an owner](https://0x213F.com/how-to-be-an-owner)

## part three: perspective from the owner

after reading the previous section, _the owner begins to worry about their assets:_

* are my employees really trying their hardest?
* are my employees as passionate as I am about this business?

_the owner_ needs to ensure their workers are productive and motivated.

to accomplish this, _the owner must understand the psychology of a cog._

<br>

## part four: the psychology of a cog

a good cog is grateful for their job. _reasons why cogs are happy and don't question their surroundings:_

* "the hours of this job are so relaxed and flexible!"
* "this job pays good money; why would i ever leave?"
* "money can't buy happiness, and this job makes me happy."
* "i literally couldn't find another job if i tried. it's tough out there."

in summary, the 4 things to focus on in order to grease up _the cogs_ are:

1. hours
1. wages
1. working conditions
1. manipulate the job market (realistically not possible)

in reality, _the owner_ simply wants people to work more and get paid less so _their investment_ generates a higher roi.

to accomplish this, _the owner must understand the psychology of an owner._

## <span id="part-five">part five: the psychology of an owner</span>

_goal: manipulate the emotional state of employees so that:_

* they accept lower wages
* put in extra hours
* are fully productive while at work

to do accomplish this, take note of how _employees_ perceive _the owner_.

**absolve your ego as an owner. you are now reborn as an employee.**

    (figure 4)

    [[ company ]] <—————— ··

    diagram: two points and an arrow pointing to the company

_employees_ uphold the company for "the greater good." as such, you transact with the company, just as any other employee would, in the name of "progress" and "success."

you work hard and "dangle the carrot" in front of yourself, just as it is for the others.

as such, you "share" the same worries as the employees. but rest assured, the company takes care of all employees as best it can.

if done correctly, this should build camaraderie amongst employees. everyone will be happily working toward a common goal due to aligned incentives.

unbeknownst to the employees: you don't work as many hours as they do. you get paid more than they do. your carrot is bigger than theirs.

you can verify things are running as expected once you have created a pyramid-like compensation structure.

## part six: rusty cogs

there are going to be some _"free thinking" cogs_ that still remain. they might be wondering:

* i don't get paid enough
* when do i get my carrot?
* what is my job security?
* why is everyone two faced?
* [[ classified ]]
* [[ classified ]]

it is probably best for <a href="#part-five">_the company_</a> to get rid of _rusty cogs_.

<br>

## part seven: getting rid of rusty cogs

follow these steps:

1: over-hire
1: "oops, we over-hired. now we have to do layoffs"
1: dispose of the rusty cogs
1: instill both fear and gratitude into those that remain
1: repeat

## part eight: now it's your turn

it is time for a self analysis. where is your company right now?
