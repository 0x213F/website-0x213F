## part one: the owner

    (figure 1)
        ·
    diagram: single point

the single point in _figure 1_ represents the business owner. the business owner controls the business and all of its operations.

obviously there is the possibility that there may be multiple business owners. for the sake of this article, **you should only be concerned with the concept of the business owner from a singular perspective.**
</details>

if the business makes less money than expected, the business will ceases to exist.

otherwise, we may assume that the business has survived.

in the case when profits exceed expenditure, the owner must consider how to reinvest the excess money. the most popular investment strategy among owners is to hire employees:

    (figure 2)

thereby, the right is born.

the choice to hire an employee is done under the presumption that the cost of their labor will be less than the value they add to the company.

ultimately, the employee is an asset and should be considered a part of the company's investment strategy.

things get a bit more complicated with equity and vc (the owners take on "more risk"). nevertheless, the core dynamic stays the same: owners operate under the assumption that the employees they hire will make them richer.

## part two: the employee

after reading the previous section, the employee begins to question their circumstances:

* do I get paid enough?
* will I get paid more if I work harder?
* will I get paid more if the business succeeds?
* what about if business goes poorly?
* why should I work hard to make the owners richer?
* is this fair?
* can I get paid more elsewhere?
* cog.meme

the worker is left with a few choices:

* do nothing; this job is a means to live my life outside of work (accept reality)
* quit and get another job (the same problems will persist at the new job)
* quit to become an owner (keep reading)

## part three: perspective from the owner

after reading the previous section, the owner begins to question their circumstances:

* are my workers really trying their hardest?
* are my employees as passionate as I am about this business?

if an owner wants to increase the value of their company, they need to ensure their workers are productive and motivated.

to accomplish this, the owner must understand the psychology of a cog.

## part four: the psychology of a cog

a good cog is grateful for their job. reasons why cogs are happy and don't question their surroundings

* "the hours of this job are so relaxed and flexible!"
* "this job pays such good money; why would i ever leave?"
* "money can't buy everything. this job rises above the rest; to my core, i enjoy being here so much."
* "i literally couldn't find another job if i tried. it's tough out there."

in summary, the 4 things to focus on in order to grease up the cogs are:

1. hours
1. wages
3. working conditions
4. manipulate the job market (unlikely you will have the power to do this)

in practice, this could mean

<ol type="a">
  <li>letting people arrive and leave the office when they please</li>
  <li>salary/ stock packages above "industry standards"</li>
  <li>todo insert third statement</li>
</ol>

in reality, you probably want to do any of those things. you simply want people to work more and get paid less.

to accomplish this, an owner must understand the psychology of an owner.

## part five: the psychology of an owner

reminder: your goal is to manipulates the emotional state of your workers so that:

* they accept lower wages
* put in extra hours
* are fully productive while at work

to do accomplish this, you must be aware of how your workers perceive you.

absolve your ego as an owner. you are now reborn as an employee.

    (figure 4)
    diagram: arrow pointing left
    {{ company }} <—————— ··

employees help uphold the company for "the greater good." As such, you transact with the company, just as any other employee would, in the name of "progress" and "success."

you work hard and "dangle the carrot" in front of yourself, just as it is for the others.

as such, you "share" the same worries as the employees. but rest assured, the company takes care of all employees as best it can.

if done correctly, this should build camaraderie amongst employees. everyone will be happily working toward a common goal due to aligned incentives.

unbeknownst to the employees, you don't work as many hours as they do. you get paid more than they do. your carrot is bigger than theirs.

you can verify things are running as expected once you have created a pyramid-like compensation structure.

## part six: rusty cogs

there are going to be some "free thinking" cogs that still remain. they might be wondering:

* i don't get paid enough
* when do I get my carrot?
* what is my job security?
* why is everyone two faced?
* [[ redacted ]]
* [[ redacted ]]

it is probably best for "the company" (see part five) to get rid of rusty cogs.

## part seven: getting rid of rusty cogs

follow these steps:

1: over-hire
2: "oops, we over-hired. now we have to do layoffs"
3: dispose of the rusty cogs
4: instill both gratitude and fear into those that remain
5: repeat
