In this post I unpack my interpretation of lyrics from the second verse of **42.26**.

## Level 1

More or less, **42.26** is identical to **Feels Like Summer**, which was released in _2018_.

If you have not listened to the song, or you need a refresher, [here is a link to the music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1B9Fk_SgI0).

## Level 2.A

The film **Guava Island** was released in _2019_. **Feels Like Summer** is part of its soundtrack.

The film is centered around conflict between Deni (Donald Glover, "free thinker") and Red Cargo ("the establishment," corporate interests).

## Level 2.B

Fast forward to the end of the film. After _Deni's organization of workers_ through song, _he is assassinated_.

## Level 3

Throughout the film there is a _caged bird_. This bird is analogous to Deni. _The bird is found dead at the end of the film_.

## Level 4

Back to **42.26**/ **Feels Like Summer**. Here are the lyrics to unpack:

> Birds were made for singing.<br>
> Waking up to no sound.<br>
> No sound.

## Level 5

Donald is referencing the bird in **Guava Island**.

## Level 6

Right after Donald sings these lyrics, the verse ends in silence. [No sound](https://0x213F.com/No-sound).

## Level 7

Donald is referencing _the future_ (from the perspective of **Feels Like Summer**).

Donald is referencing _the past_ (from the perspective of **42.26**).

## Level 8

In my understanding, I have developed the following conclusion:

> If you threaten "the establishment," your voice will be suppressed.<br>
> If the effort to suppress your voice fails, you will be killed.

## Level 9

From various justifications (not discussed here), you may reach the conclusion that the establishment suppressed both **Guava Island** and **03.15.20** from receiving the recognition they deserve.

## Level 10

In this regard, Donald's art is a self-fulfilling prophecy.

## Level 11

> I know you know the pain.<br>
> I'm hoping this world would change.<br>
> But it just stays the same.
